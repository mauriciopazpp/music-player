# Honey Tunes 🎵

This project went beyond what I expected because I had so much fun doing it! 😄
The experience of developing this app was so amazing that I'm already planning to connect it to a free music API. Who knows, maybe even release it officially?! 🚀

## 🚀 Project Description

Honey Tunes is a simple app that allows you to search for artists and display a list of their albums, using the free API from [TheAudioDB](https://www.theaudiodb.com/api_guide.php). The initial goal was just a test, but the project turned out so cool that I decided to take it further and explore new possibilities.

## 🛠 How to Install and Run

Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:mauriciopazpp/music-player.git
```

## Install dependencies:
```sh
npm i
```

Run the project in production (build + Next.js server):
```sh
npm run production
```

To modify the code and run in development mode:
```sh
npm run dev
```

### Warnings
The free API used has a limitation, so the search is restricted only to coldplay in lowercase. However, the entire code is ready to handle broader searches, just by removing the API's restrictions!

If you want to test performance hitting 100% in all criteria, use production mode:
```sh
npm run production
```
